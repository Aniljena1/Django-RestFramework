Generics Concept
====== =======
The generic views of Django Rest Framework help us in code reusablity. 

generics module providing the so many classes to perform the Data base operations. 

It is also providing some combination classes to to perform the multiple actions at a time.



Example:
========
ListAPIView:		 It is used to get all the data

CreateAPIView:		 It is used to create the new record into database	



RetrieveAPIView:        It is used to get any specific data  based on id

UpdateAPIView:		It is used to modify any specific data based on id

DestroyAPIView:	        It is used to delete any specific data based on id





ListCreateAPIView:  
                        It is used to get all data and also to post the data
                       (Here, It can perform both non-key based operations)


RetrieveUpdateAPIView:	
	                It is used to get one data or update any specific data



RetrieveDestroyAPIView:		
          It is used to get any specific data or to delete any specific data



RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView:
	    It is used to get any specific data or update any specific data or  delete             any specific data.




Here , we no need of writing the  handler and action methods name directly. we required only queryset and serializer_class fields .










==================


1. The ListModelMixin provides the list() function for serializing a collection to JSON and then returning it as a response to a GET request.

2. The CreateModelMixin meanwhile provides the create() function for creating a new object in response to a POST request.

3. Finally, the GenericAPIView mixin provides the “core” functionality needed for a RESTful API.
