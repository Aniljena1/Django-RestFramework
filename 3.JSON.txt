JSON Syntax Rules:
=====  =====
JSON Data by using  in "Key and value" pairs we are writing.

Key and values separated by colon(:) ,
All key/value pairs with in the Curly braces.

example:

In JSON structure , Curly braces hold the objects and Square brackets hlod the Arrays

Each key and value should be in a Double quotes if it is strings.

Why do we use JSON?
=================
The JSON format is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. 

It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative to XML. 

JSON is JavaScript Object Notation.



Why JSON is Better than XML ?? 
=-=======================
XML is a much more difficult to Parse the data than JSON.

For AJAXs  applications , JSON is Faster and easier than XML.

JSON  doesn't use the Tags . JSON is Shorter and Use Arrays.

It is very Fast to read and write the data

JSON is Parsed into a ready-to-use javascipt object

Examples:

Q )   Write a program to define an Employees object with an  Array  of 3 employees by uing JSON structure ????




Using JSON:
=========
{
      "employees" : [
                { "fname" : "Srinivas" , "lname" : "Rao" } ,
                { "fname" :  "Virat", "lname" : "Kohli" } ,    
                { "fname" : "Rohit" , "lname" : "Sharma" } , 
       ]
}


Q )   Write a program to define an Employees object with an  Array  of 3 employees by uing XML structure ????

<employees>
        <employee>
                  <fname>Srinivas </fname>
                  <lname>Rao </lname>
       </employee>

        <employee>
                  <fname>Rohit </fname>
                  <lname>Sharma </lname>
       </employee>
       
       <employee>
                  <fname> Virat</fname>
                  <lname>Kohli </lname>
       </employee>
</employees>
